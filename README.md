This is code to find the shortest path between two node of Binary search tree
Shortes Path
In this program there are three method 
1. findLCA 
2. getDestance: To find the distance between node and value
3. FindShortestPath : To get the shortest path between two node 
BSTnode is used to create BST node.
BSTMain is the main program
